BookCmp
=======

A light weight(gevent, greenlet) application which returns JSON of details of book
from different portal

the JSON payload contains list of all books for the search query, and each book has
info like title, isbn, url, prices of different vendors. 

TODO:
=====

1. make searchable URLs (hardcoded)
2. deduplicate (books with same ISBN should be put in same dict)
3. cache book info.
4. simple UI (angular)

Intention:
its Fucking Weekend.
